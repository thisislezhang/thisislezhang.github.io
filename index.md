Dr. Le Zhang is an Assistant Professor at the School of Engineering, College of Engineering and Physical Sciences in the University of Birmingham. He was a Postdoc Researcher at the University of Oxford since 2022. Before that, he was a Research Fellow at University College London since 2019 working with **Prof. Daniel Alexander, Prof. Olga Ciccarelli and Prof. Frederik Barkhof**. Under the supervision of **Prof. Alejandro F Frangi**, he obtained his Ph.D. in Medical Image Computing from the University of Sheffield in 2019.
<br>
<br>
His research is focused on computational modelling, pattern recognition, and machine learning for biomedical imaging and data analysis. His research aims to add understanding and capability in biomedicine by drawing on ideas from medical imaging, computer vision, data science, and machine learning. Much of his work focusses on Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Image Analysis, Multi-Modality Neuroimage Analysis, and Retinal Fundus Image Analysis. His research has been published in top conferences and journals in the fields of machine learning and medical image analysis, including NeurIPS, MICCAI, Medical Image Analysis and Pattern Recognition, and nominated for the **MICCAI Young Scientist Award** in 2019.

<br>
Dr. Le Zhang serves as an Honorary Research Fellow actively associated with the William Harvey Research Institute, Barts Heart Center, Barts Health NHS Trust, Queen Mary University of London. In this role, he collaborates closely with **Dr. Nay Aung**, Senior Clinical Lecturer and Consultant Cardiologist, and **Prof. Steffen Petersen**, Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine, to develop explainable machine learning and AI models leveraging the UK Biobank dataset. His work focuses on creating innovative computational approaches to improve the interpretability of AI-driven predictions in cardiovascular imaging, with the aim of enhancing clinical decision-making and advancing personalized medicine in cardiology.
