The following projects are what my team is working on. Happy to receive suggestions and collabrations on these work.

### Generative AI for Medical Imaging

Generative AI for medical imaging involves the use of artificial intelligence techniques, particularly generative models, to assist in various tasks within the field of medical imaging. These models can generate realistic images from scratch or modify existing images to improve their quality or highlight specific features. Key techniques include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and more recently, Transformers and Stable Diffusion. These techniques hold promise in enhancing medical imaging workflows by generating synthetic data for training deep learning models, improving image quality, aiding in disease diagnosis, and even facilitating personalized treatment plans. However, challenges such as the need for large and diverse datasets, ensuring the clinical relevance and safety of generated images, and interpretability of AI-generated results remain areas of active research and development. Despite these challenges, generative AI continues to show significant potential in revolutionizing medical imaging by providing tools to assist clinicians in more accurate and efficient diagnoses and treatments.
